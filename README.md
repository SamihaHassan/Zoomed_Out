# Zoomed_Out
nwHacks 2021 Project

## Purpose

Feeling that Zoom fatigue, constantly zoning out during long meetings without ever needing to speak up, want to support your prof with your smilling face but also want to chill in PJs? Look no further, ZoomedOut has got your back.

Set up this virtual camera and always look your best for your fellow peers. Our intelligent virtual camera will react in real time to what's happenining in your meeting so you cry or laugh on time without having to actively pay attention. Use this saved time to make 2021 as productive as possible. Our program also will alert you if your name has been mentioned and save the key points of the meeting for you to review later. 

ZoomedOut is also great for turning on your camera for your classes to support your professors so they don't have to stare into the voice while teaching. Show your smilling, appreciative self looking your best all from the comfort of your bed.
